## 1) Problem Statement
Many online game platforms for kids are overloaded with ads, unsafe links, or inappropriate content. Parents often want a single, safe, and curated destination where their children can play educational and fun web-based games — without tracking, aggressive monetization, or the need for constant supervision.

---

## 2) Goals & Objectives
- **Provide a safe, ad-free gaming environment** for children aged 4–12.  
- **Curate educational and creative games** that are browser-based and require no installation.  
- **Offer parental controls** for time limits and content category restrictions.  
- **Enable offline play** for selected games using Progressive Web App (PWA) features.

---

## 3) Target Users
- **Primary:** Parents seeking a safe and fun web gaming platform for their children.  
- **Secondary:** Educators looking for quick, classroom-friendly game access.  
- **Tertiary:** Kids looking for fun, creative, and non-intrusive online play.

## 5) Non-Functional Requirements
- **Safety:** COPPA-compliant; no data collection beyond anonymized usage metrics.  
- **Performance:** Games load in < 5 seconds on standard home internet.  
- **Reliability:** Platform uptime > 99%; cached offline play stable.  
- **Accessibility:** Games and UI fully navigable by touch; basic screen reader compatibility.

---

## 6) Constraints
- All games must be **HTML5/JavaScript** based (no plugins).  
- Limited to browser capabilities; no heavy 3D or VR for MVP.  
- Small dev budget; focus on existing open-license or self-developed mini-games.

---

## 7) Tech Stack Suggestion
- **Frontend:** React + Tailwind CSS or SvelteKit for performance.  
- **Backend:** Node.js with lightweight API for game metadata & parental controls.  
- **Database:** SQLite or Supabase for cloud sync.  
- **Offline/PWA:** Workbox for service worker caching.  
- **Hosting:** Netlify, Vercel, or Cloudflare Pages.

- **Retention:** ≥ 50% returning visitors after first month.

## 10) Risks & Mitigation
